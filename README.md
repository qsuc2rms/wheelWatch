It looks like a normal clock, an night bg image indicates that current time is at night.

You can set a timer by touching the time needle, touch around the hour needle will start the set, it will also indicate the time span by a red arc.

You may find it difficult to set an exact time by minute, touch the outer side of the clock to raise a ring indicating the timer by minute.

According to your target time, the bg image will indicate that it will be daytime or at night.

More ideas to be done
1.Should be able to set next 24 hours, now is restircted to 12 hours, current disign is to use 2 arc, one smaller one inside for next 12 hours, one bigger one outside for next 12~24 hours.
2.Enhance current day & night indication to sun & moon with a background color, fade in and fade out.
3.Current clock should be add while shells for each item to be seen clearly both on light bg and on dark bg.
4.The function to check day & night should be enhanced to consider date & month & geo location, weather is also welcome to add in.
